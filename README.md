# react-bootstrap
Simple app bootstrap based on ejected [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), but with:
- JSS
- Slightly more anal ESLint

It can be installed, started and built using the same scripts defined in [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app):

### Install
`yarn install`

### Run dev server
`yarn start`

### Build for prod
`yarn build`
